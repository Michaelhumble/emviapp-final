# üîí PAID JOB POSTING - LIVE TESTING GUIDE

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS

### üß™ TEST MODE (Simulation Only)
- **Route**: `/post-job-paid-test`
- **Navigation**: Only visible in development or with `?test=true`
- **Payment**: Simulated - NO real Stripe charges
- **Database**: Jobs are NOT saved to live database
- **Visibility**: Jobs do NOT appear on Jobs page
- **Purpose**: UI/UX testing and form validation only

### üî¥ PRODUCTION MODE (Real Payment Flow)
- **Route**: `/post-job` 
- **Navigation**: Always visible as "Post Paid Job"
- **Payment**: Real Stripe payment (use test cards to avoid charges)
- **Database**: Jobs saved to main Supabase `jobs` table
- **Visibility**: Jobs appear immediately on Jobs page after payment
- **Purpose**: Live job posting with real payment processing

## üß™ TESTING REAL PAID JOBS (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Access Production Flow
1. Navigate to `/post-job` (NOT `/post-job-paid-test`)
2. You should see the job template selector
3. Warning banners should indicate this is the REAL payment flow

### Step 2: Complete Job Form
1. Select any job template (Nail Tech, Hair Stylist, etc.)
2. Fill out all required fields
3. Submit the form to proceed to payment

### Step 3: Payment with Test Card
Use these Stripe test card numbers to avoid real charges:
- **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Decline**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **3D Secure**: `4000 0000 0000 3220`
- **Expiry**: Any future date (e.g., 12/26)
- **CVC**: Any 3-digit number (e.g., 123)

### Step 4: Verify Success
After successful payment, you should see:
1. ‚úÖ Success page with payment confirmation
2. ‚úÖ Toast notifications confirming job is live
3. ‚úÖ Job appears immediately on `/jobs` page
4. ‚úÖ Job exists in Supabase `jobs` table with `status: 'active'`

## üîç VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

### Payment Verification
- [ ] Stripe test payment processed successfully
- [ ] Webhook received and processed (check Supabase function logs)
- [ ] No real money charged (using test card)

### Database Verification
- [ ] Job exists in Supabase `jobs` table
- [ ] Job status is `active` (not `draft`)
- [ ] All form fields correctly saved
- [ ] `pricing_tier` set correctly (not 'free')

### Frontend Verification

- [ ] Job card displays properly with all details
- [ ] No test jobs from `/post-job-paid-test` appear on Jobs page

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### Job Not Appearing on Jobs Page
1. Check Supabase `jobs` table - is the job there?
2. Check job `status` - should be `active`, not `draft`
3. Check Stripe webhook logs for errors
4. Check browser console for any errors

### Payment Issues
1. Verify Stripe test keys are configured
2. Check webhook endpoint is accessible
3. Check Supabase function logs for webhook processing

### Webhook Not Firing

2. Verify webhook URL is correct
3. Check webhook signing secret

## üì± TESTING ON DIFFERENT DEVICES

A successful test means:
1. Payment processes without errors
2. Job appears on Jobs page within 30 seconds
3. Job data is complete and accurate
4. No test jobs leak into production
