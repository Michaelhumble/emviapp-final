## Quick comparison (beauty-specific)

| Assistant | Best for | Where it struggles | Typical personal plan | Beauty-job to “hire” it for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ChatGPT** | Writing, brainstorming, rewriting in your brand voice | Can over-generalize if you give no examples | Paid tier for higher limits | Job posts, bios, captions, menus, emails |
| **Claude** | Long documents, careful reasoning, clean JSON/tables | Less obvious web grounding | Paid tier for higher limits | SOPs, policies, onboarding checklists, forms |
| **Gemini** | Google integration, images, mobile capture | Can be terse—guide it | Paid tier for “Advanced” | Image explanations, Google-workspace tasks, mobile |
| **Perplexity** | **Live research with citations**, quick links | Concise by design—ask for “expand” | Pro for higher caps | Market checks, city trends, pricing research |

## FAQ

**Can I trust AI with facts?**  
Treat it like a fast assistant, not a final source. Use **Perplexity** for linked answers, then open and read.

**Do I need paid plans?**  
Free tiers are fine to learn. Paid tiers buy you time: higher limits, better models, fewer rate limits.

**Will AI replace my brand voice?**  
No. Give 2–3 examples of your own captions or emails. Ask the AI to mimic **that** voice.

**What about client privacy?**  
Never paste private data. Summarize or redact specifics before you ask for help.

**Which is best for images?**  
For captions and copy, ChatGPT/Claude shine. For image understanding and quick mobile tasks, **Gemini** is handy. For image generation/editing, use dedicated tools separately.

**What should I never outsource to AI?**  
Pricing decisions and safety policies. Use AI to draft, then **you** decide.
