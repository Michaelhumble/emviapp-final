# Midjourney vs Stable Diffusion: Which to Use in 2025

Pick quickly: Midjourney for gorgeous output with minimal setup; Stable Diffusion (SDXL/SD3) for maximum control and local workflows.

## TL;DR
- Midjourney: easiest path to beautiful images; Discord/app flow; strong styles; closed weights.
- Stable Diffusion: local/cloud options (ComfyUI, A1111); LoRA/ControlNet; open weights; highest control.
- Cost: Midjourney subscription; SD can be cheap but time‑intensive.

## Quick comparison

| Feature | Midjourney | Stable Diffusion (SDXL/SD3) |
|---|---|---|
| Install | None (Discord/app) | Local/A1111/ComfyUI/cloud |
| Styles | Excellent presets | Infinite via models/LoRA |
| Control | Low‑medium | High (ControlNet, nodes) |
| Speed | Fast | Varies by GPU/pipeline |
| Cost | Monthly sub | GPU time; can be free local |

## What creators prefer
- Branding/ads: Midjourney for speed and polish
- Product/technical art: SDXL with ControlNet nodes for precision
- Anime: Midjourney Niji or SD anime models

## Cost and speed
- Midjourney: predictable monthly cost; limited fine‑control
- SD: upfront setup time; scalable in cloud; best for power users

## Try it now
Prompts to copy:
- Midjourney: “luxury product lay‑flat, soft gradient backdrop, crisp reflections, 50mm photography, cinematic lighting, minimalist aesthetic —v 6 —ar 4:5”
- SDXL (ComfyUI): “Use ControlNet depth to match this pose; apply LoRA [style]; upscale 2x; add rim light”

## FAQ
1) Is SD free? Local installs can be; cloud costs by GPU minutes.
2) Which is better quality? Midjourney default; SD wins with time and control.

## Key takeaways
- Choose by deadline and control needs; keep both in your toolkit.
