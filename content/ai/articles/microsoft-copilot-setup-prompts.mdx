# Microsoft Copilot: Setup + Best Prompts (2025)

## TL;DR
- Sign in with your work or personal Microsoft account; check your plan (Copilot Pro/M365).
- Use in Excel/PowerPoint for the biggest ROI: analyze tables and draft decks.
- Save reusable prompts as “recipes” for your team.

## Quick setup
1) Windows/Edge: Enable Copilot in the sidebar; sign in.
2) Office apps: Update to latest builds; turn on the Copilot ribbon; confirm license.
3) Privacy: Review tenant settings for data retention and plugins.

## Best prompts by app
- Excel: “Explain this table’s outliers; create a new sheet with 3 charts and 5 takeaways; flag anomalies.”
- PowerPoint: “Turn this outline into a 10‑slide deck with speaker notes and a simple gradient theme.”
- Outlook: “Draft a reply that confirms A, asks B, and proposes C by Friday.”
- Teams: “Summarize this meeting with action items, owners, and deadlines.”

## Troubleshooting
- “Copilot not working” in Office: Check updates, license entitlement, and tenant toggles.
- Data leakage fears: Use enterprise controls; disable third‑party connectors if needed.

## Try it now
Paste into Excel Copilot: “Analyze columns A:K for seasonality; return 3 visuals and 5 bullet insights.”

## FAQ
1) Do I need Copilot Pro? Not if your org already has M365 enterprise entitlements.
2) Does it work offline? No; it runs in Microsoft’s cloud.

## Key takeaways
- Start with Excel/PowerPoint; templatize what works.
