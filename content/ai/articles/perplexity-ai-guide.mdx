# Perplexity AI Guide: Research Like a Pro (2025)

Cited answers, fast updates, and clean follow‑ups—Perplexity is the research sidekick the web needed.

## TL;DR
- Use focus modes (writing, academic, coding) and follow‑ups to drill down.
- Collect sources with “Citations” and save to Collections.
- Notebooks = scoped research briefs; export/share for teams.
- Pro unlocks better models and longer context.

## Why Perplexity
- Query growth: CEO cited ~780M monthly queries (May 2025), growing 20% MoM (Search Engine Land).
- Strengths: fast, source‑first, reliable follow‑ups; great for “what changed this week?”
- When not to use: heavy creative writing or long multi‑step coding—pair with Claude/ChatGPT.

## Setup in minutes
1) Create account → enable Pro if you need longer context.
2) Learn the UI: left panel (threads, Collections), top modes (focus), right panel (citations).
3) Keyboard: Enter to send; Shift+Enter for line breaks.
4) Privacy: review data retention; use Pro/org settings for control.

## Workflows that ship
- Weekly briefing: “Summarize the last 7 days in [topic]. Cite 6–8 sources with dates.” → Pin the best. Save as a Collection.
- Vendor due diligence: “Compare [X] vs [Y]. Include pricing, SLA, security, and roadmap links.”
- Academic skim: “Find the most‑cited papers on [topic] since 2023. Extract 5 key findings each.”
- Competitive sweep: “What changed on [competitor] pricing page in 90 days? Capture deltas with links.”

## Try it now
Paste:
- “List major AI assistant feature updates in the last 30 days (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot, Perplexity). Link sources with dates.”
- “Build a 10‑row table of ‘vs’ comparisons people search for, with criteria: price, context, coding, images, web, best for.”

## FAQ
1) Are citations reliable? They’re surfaced; you still verify.
2) Does it replace ChatGPT? No—pair them: Perplexity to research, Claude/ChatGPT to write.
3) What about privacy? Check org settings and Pro’s retention controls.

## Key takeaways
- Use Perplexity to gather and verify; draft elsewhere; return to validate.
