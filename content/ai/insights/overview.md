# Global AI Assistants Search — Insights Summary (Q3 2025)

This overview distills what people are actually searching for about AI assistants/tools globally right now, based on public, best‑available signals (Semrush keyword lists, Similarweb reports, Google Trends orientation data, news, and vendor updates). Values in the CSV are estimates and directional for planning.

Key takeaways
- ChatGPT remains the world’s dominant AI assistant search term (~618M monthly searches globally per Semrush Top Keywords 2025), but share is fragmenting as Google pushes Gemini and AI Overviews/AI Mode.
- Perplexity is the fastest-growing “AI answer engine” by query volume; CEO stated ~780M monthly queries in May (Search Engine Land, 2025-06), with strong MoM growth.
- Gemini’s demand tracks closely with Google feature rollouts (AI Overviews, AI Mode) and Workspace integration; navigational and “vs” queries surging.
- Claude interest is concentrated among power users (coding, long-context, artifacts/computer use); high-value B2B intent with medium volumes.
- Copilot demand is broad because it’s bundled: Windows 11, Edge, Microsoft 365—strong transactional intent around Excel/PowerPoint prompts.
- Image models split intent: Midjourney’s creative community drives prompts/styles how‑to; Stable Diffusion skews technical (SDXL, ComfyUI, A1111, ControlNet) and local installs.
- Character.AI skews younger entertainment/social; massive engagement, high navigational queries; monetization queries (“plus”, “nsfw filter”) persist.
- Meta AI demand follows WhatsApp/Instagram launches; navigational queries (“WhatsApp,” “countries,” “opt out”) are rising as rollouts expand.

What clusters win now (Opportunity Score = (volume × growth) ÷ difficulty)
1) “How to use” + beginner setup for Copilot, Gemini, Perplexity (high volume, rising features, medium difficulty)
2) “Prompts by job/use case” for ChatGPT/Copilot/Midjourney (evergreen, shareable, medium difficulty)
3) “Vs” head‑to‑heads: ChatGPT vs Gemini vs Claude (spikes with launches, high linkability)
4) Pricing & plans: Copilot Pro, Gemini Advanced, Perplexity Pro (transactional, medium difficulty)
5) Image features: Midjourney styles, SDXL ControlNet/ComfyUI (high searcher problem-fit)
6) Troubleshooting: “not working,” rate limits, privacy/opt‑out (quick wins, low difficulty)

Quick wins
- Launch Perplexity beginner guide + research prompts cheatsheet
- Copilot in Excel/PowerPoint: templates + prompt libraries
- ChatGPT vs Gemini vs Claude: updated comparison with benchmarks, pricing, and use-case picks
- Midjourney vs Stable Diffusion: practical decisions + prompt matrices
- Meta AI & Character.AI social use: practical, safe usage, and privacy tips

Method notes
- Volumes/difficulty are directional using public lists and observed trend data; Google Trends informs growth direction (↑/↓). Country leaders derived from tool country splits and platform rollouts.
- We update the CSV as features change (Gemini/AI Mode rollouts, Claude artifacts/computer use, Perplexity Pro improvements, Midjourney model updates, SD3/Flux/SDXL pipelines, Meta AI regions).

30/60/90‑day refresh plan
- 30d: Re‑crawl brand query volumes; update pricing tables (Copilot, Gemini Advanced, Perplexity Pro); track AI Overviews/AI Mode rollouts and add “how to disable/opt‑out” FAQs.
- 60d: Re‑test “vs” comparisons (benchmarks, latency, context limits, image/voice); add new examples; rotate prompt libraries by job role performance.
- 90d: Reforecast cluster Opportunity Scores; retire low‑performers, double down on rising segments (e.g., Perplexity research workflows; SDXL/ComfyUI pipelines); ship new tables for any major model versions.
