### Files verified:
- src/App.tsx - Route properly configured
- src/pages/affiliate/AffiliateSettings.tsx - Component implemented
- src/pages/affiliate/AffiliateDashboard.tsx - Navigation link present
- supabase/functions/ - Edge functions deployed

### How to access:
1. **Login required**: Visit `/affiliate/settings` - will redirect to auth if not logged in
2. **From dashboard**: `/affiliate/dashboard` → "Account Settings" button
3. **Direct URL**: https://your-domain.com/affiliate/settings

### Testing steps:
1. Navigate to `/affiliate/settings` while authenticated
2. Should show Stripe Connect status and payout settings
3. "Connect Payouts" button should call `affiliate-connect-start` edge function
4. "Refresh Status" button should call `affiliate-connect-status` edge function

### Potential issues:
- User might not be authenticated (ProtectedRoute redirect)
- User might not be accessing the correct URL path
- Browser cache might be showing old version

### No changes needed - everything is properly wired up.
