              <strong>It was 2 AM in a Houston nail salon.</strong> Mai, a Vietnamese nail technician with 15 years of experience, was scrolling through Facebook Groups, desperately searching for her next opportunity. The salon she'd worked at for years was closing, and she needed to find work fast to support her family.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              What she found broke her heart: spam posts, fake job listings, and predatory offers that didn't respect her skills or experience. "There has to be a better way," she whispered, looking at the family photo on her nail station.

              <strong>EmviApp's story began in the heart of Vietnamese nail communities across America.</strong> We watched as hardworking families built empires from nothing, creating beautiful spaces where artistry and service excellence thrived. But these talented professionals were underserved by technology that didn't understand their unique needs.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                <strong>Vietnamese nail technicians control 80% of nail salons in America</strong> — a $8.5 billion industry built on family values, incredible work ethic, and artistic excellence. Yet they were forced to use platforms that didn't respect their culture, their language, or their professional standards.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                EmviApp was born to change that. We started by serving Vietnamese nail communities with bilingual support, cultural understanding, and features designed for their specific needs. <strong>But we didn't stop there.</strong>

              Today, EmviApp serves <strong>nail technicians, hair stylists, barbers, estheticians, massage therapists, lash artists, makeup artists, and salon owners</strong> from every background. What started as a solution for one community has become the platform that's uniting the entire beauty industry.
