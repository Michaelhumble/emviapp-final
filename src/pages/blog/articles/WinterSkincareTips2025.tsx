          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Start with an oil-based cleanser to remove makeup and sunscreen, followed by a gentle cream cleanser. This method prevents over-drying while ensuring thorough cleansing.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Layer Your Serums Strategically</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Apply serums from thinnest to thickest consistency. Start with hyaluronic acid on damp skin, follow with vitamin C in the morning or retinol at night, then seal with a rich moisturizer.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li>Morning: Vitamin C serum + SPF</li>
            <li>Evening: Retinol or peptide serums</li>
            <li>Both: Hyaluronic acid on damp skin</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">3. Invest in a Humidifier</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Indoor heating systems strip moisture from the air and your skin. A bedroom humidifier can work wonders for maintaining skin hydration while you sleep.

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">4. Switch to Cream-Based Products</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Replace gel-based cleansers and moisturizers with cream formulations. Look for ingredients like ceramides, shea butter, and squalane for optimal winter protection.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">5. Don't Skip SPF</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            UV rays reflect off snow and can cause damage even in winter. Choose a broad-spectrum SPF 30+ and apply it daily, especially if you're hitting the slopes.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">6. Gentle Exfoliation Strategy</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Reduce exfoliation frequency but don't stop entirely. Use a gentle chemical exfoliant (like lactic acid) once or twice weekly to remove dead skin cells without irritation.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">7. Overnight Mask Treatments</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Incorporate overnight hydrating masks 2-3 times per week. Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and natural oils for intense moisture repair.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">8. Protect Your Lips and Hands</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            These areas are often forgotten but suffer the most in winter. Use a thick lip balm with SPF and keep hand cream with you at all times.

        <section>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">9. Stay Hydrated from Within</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Drink plenty of water and consider omega-3 supplements. Foods rich in healthy fats like avocados and nuts also support skin barrier function.
