                The beauty industry is experiencing an unprecedented transformation. Salon owners are struggling with staff shortages, customers are abandoning traditional booking methods, and expensive software solutions are draining budgets while delivering minimal results. Sound familiar?
              </p>

              <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-12 text-muted-foreground">
                Enter <Link to="/" className="text-primary font-semibold hover:underline">EmviApp</Link> – the all-in-one platform the beauty industry has been waiting for. But this isn't just another booking app. It's a complete ecosystem designed to solve the real problems facing beauty professionals today.
              </p>

              {/* Section 1 */}
              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-foreground">The Real Struggles of Salon Owners & Artists</h2>
              
              <p className="mb-6">
                Let's be honest about what's really happening in beauty salons across the country. Sarah, a salon owner in Austin, recently shared her frustration: "I'm paying $200+ monthly for booking software that half my clients can't figure out, while talented artists are walking away because they can't afford the chair rental increases."
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                She's not alone. Industry data reveals alarming trends:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>73% of salon owners</strong> report difficulty finding and retaining skilled artists</li>
                <li><strong>68% of customers</strong> have abandoned bookings due to complicated scheduling systems</li>
                <li><strong>$3,000+ annually</strong> – what the average salon spends on disconnected software solutions</li>
                <li><strong>45% increase</strong> in independent artist preference over traditional salon employment</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="mb-12">
                The traditional salon model is breaking down, but the demand for beauty services has never been higher. The missing piece? A platform that bridges this gap while empowering everyone in the beauty ecosystem.
              </p>

              {/* Section 2 */}
              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-foreground">The Vision Behind EmviApp</h2>

              <p className="mb-6">
                EmviApp was born from a simple yet powerful vision: <em>What if technology could eliminate barriers instead of creating them?</em> Our founder, a former beauty industry professional, witnessed firsthand how outdated systems were holding back talented artists and innovative salon owners.
              </p>

              <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-6 italic text-xl mb-8 text-muted-foreground">
                "Every artist deserves the opportunity to build their dream career, and every salon owner deserves tools that grow their business instead of draining it. That's the EmviApp promise."
              </blockquote>

              <p className="mb-6">
                This vision drives every feature, every decision, and every interaction on our platform. We're not just building software; we're cultivating a community where success is shared, connections are authentic, and growth has no limits.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-12">
                Our mission extends beyond convenience. We're creating an ecosystem built on three core principles: <strong>Trust</strong> (verified profiles and transparent reviews), <strong>Transparency</strong> (no hidden fees or surprise charges), and <strong>Technology</strong> (AI-powered matching that actually works).
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Innovation Without Complexity</h3>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Community-Driven Development</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Every feature we build starts with feedback from real beauty professionals. We're not guessing what the industry needs – we're listening and responding.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Sustainable Growth Model</h3>
              <p className="mb-12">
                Unlike platforms that profit from artist fees, our success is tied to the success of our community. When you grow, we grow. This alignment creates a sustainable ecosystem that benefits everyone.
