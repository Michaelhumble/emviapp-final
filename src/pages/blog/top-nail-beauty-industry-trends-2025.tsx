        <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p>
            As we settle into 2025, the nail and beauty industry continues to surprise us with innovative trends that blend technology, sustainability, and artistry. Whether you're a seasoned nail technician or just starting your beauty career, staying ahead of these trends is crucial for attracting and retaining clients.
          </p>

          <p>
            This year's trends reflect a broader cultural shift toward personalization, wellness, and environmental consciousness. Clients aren't just looking for beautiful nails—they want experiences that align with their values and lifestyles. Let's dive into what's driving the industry forward this year.
          </p>

          <h2>1. AI-Powered Personalization</h2>

          <h3>Smart Color Matching</h3>
          <p>
            Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing how we choose nail colors. New AI-powered apps can analyze a client's skin tone, wardrobe, and even mood to suggest the perfect shade. Some salons are already implementing smart mirrors that use AI to show clients how different colors will look on their nails before application.
          </p>

          <p>
            This technology is particularly game-changing for clients with unique skin tones who have struggled to find their perfect match. The AI considers undertones, lighting conditions, and even the occasion to make recommendations that human eyes might miss.
          </p>

          <h3>Predictive Nail Health</h3>
          <p>
            Advanced scanning technology can now analyze nail health and predict potential issues before they become visible. This allows nail technicians to recommend preventive treatments and customize services based on each client's specific nail needs.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Sustainable and Clean Beauty</h2>

          <h3>Eco-Friendly Formulations</h3>
          <p>
            The demand for non-toxic, eco-friendly nail products has reached a tipping point in 2025. Clients are increasingly concerned about the chemicals they're exposed to, leading to a surge in:

This includes solar-powered equipment, carbon offset programs, and partnerships with environmental organizations. Clients are choosing salons based on their environmental impact, making sustainability a competitive advantage.
          </p>

          <h3>Zero-Waste Practices</h3>

          </p>

          <h3>Mood-Responsive Polish</h3>
          <p>
            Thermochromic and UV-reactive polishes have evolved beyond simple color changes. New formulations can respond to stress levels, heart rate, and even blood sugar levels, making nails a form of health monitoring and self-expression.
