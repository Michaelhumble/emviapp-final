                  <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Pricing in the beauty industry varies significantly based on location, experience, and specialization. Understanding market rates helps you make informed decisions and negotiate fairly.

                    Major metropolitan areas typically command higher rates than smaller cities. For example, professionals in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco often charge 20-40% more than those in smaller markets. Factor in cost of living when evaluating pricing proposals.

                    The most expensive professional isn't always the best choice, but extremely low prices can indicate inexperience or quality issues. Focus on value â€“ the combination of skill level, reliability, and client satisfaction â€“ rather than price alone.
