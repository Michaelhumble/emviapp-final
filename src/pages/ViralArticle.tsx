                Mai Nguyen stood behind the counter of her nail salon in Houston, watching customers walk past her window without even glancing inside. Six months after opening "Golden Lotus Nails," she had served maybe thirty clients total. Her English was getting better, but in a city of millions, she felt completely invisible.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
                "I had fifteen years of experience in Vietnam," Mai recalls, her voice soft but determined. "I could create nail art that looked like tiny paintings. But here, nobody knew who I was. Nobody could find me."

                Today, eighteen months later, Mai's calendar is booked solid for three weeks out. Her salon has a 4.9-star rating and a waiting list of loyal customers. Her nail art photos have been shared thousands of times on social media. She's even started teaching other Vietnamese nail artists how to build their businesses in America.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Mai's story isn't just about nail salons or the beauty industry. It's about something much more universal: the human need to be seen, valued, and connected to community. Whether you're a software engineer in Silicon Valley, a teacher in rural Texas, or a barista in downtown Seattle, you've probably felt invisible at some point in your life.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
                The beauty industry, it turns out, is a perfect mirror for these universal human experiences. When someone sits in a salon chair, they're not just getting their hair done or nails painted—they're engaging in an ancient ritual of transformation, self-care, and human connection.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6">
                EmviApp began with a simple observation: the beauty industry, worth over $500 billion globally, was still operating like it was 1995. Talented artists were struggling to find good jobs. Salon owners couldn't connect with the right professionals. Customers had no easy way to discover the perfect stylist for their needs.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-8">
                But beneath these practical problems lay something deeper—a cultural bridge that needed building. In cities across America, some of the most skilled beauty professionals are immigrants, particularly from Vietnamese and other Asian communities. Yet language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of visibility kept them from reaching their full potential.
