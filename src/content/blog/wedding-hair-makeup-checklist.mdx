## Frequently Asked Questions

**When should I book my wedding hair and makeup artists?**
Book 4-6 months in advance for most markets, 8-12 months for popular artists in major cities. Peak wedding season (May-October) requires earlier booking. Popular artists fill up quickly, especially for Saturday weddings.

**How many trial sessions do I need?**
Most brides need 2 trial sessions - one for initial testing and refinement, and a second to perfect the final look. Brides with specific vision or complex requirements may need additional trials. Schedule the final trial 4-6 weeks before your wedding.

**Should I do my own makeup or hire a professional?**
Professional makeup artists ensure camera-ready, long-lasting results and reduce wedding day stress. However, if you're skilled with makeup and prefer a natural look, DIY can work. Consider your comfort level, photography plans, and time constraints.

**What questions should I ask potential artists during consultations?**
Ask about their experience with weddings, product lines used, trial policies, timeline management, backup plans, and view recent bridal portfolios. Discuss your venue, season, and any skin sensitivities or preferences.

**How much should I tip my wedding hair and makeup artists?**
Standard tipping is 15-25% of the service cost, given on the wedding day. For exceptional service or if artists go above and beyond, consider 20-25%. Coordinate tips in advance and designate someone to handle payments.

**What if I don't like my trial results?**
Communicate specific concerns immediately and schedule adjustments. Most artists want you completely satisfied and will work to refine the look. If fundamental style differences exist, it may be better to find a different artist early in the process.

**How do I coordinate timing with my photographer?**
Share your beauty timeline with your photographer early in planning. They can suggest optimal timing for getting-ready photos, detail shots, and first look moments. Allow buffer time between beauty completion and photography.

**What happens if my artist gets sick on my wedding day?**
Professional artists should have backup plans and colleague networks. Ask about emergency policies during booking. Consider having a backup artist identified or basic DIY skills as secondary insurance.
