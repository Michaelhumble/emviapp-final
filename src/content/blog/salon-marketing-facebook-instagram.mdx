## Frequently Asked Questions

**How often should I post on Instagram and Facebook?**
Aim for 5-7 Instagram posts per week and 3-5 Facebook posts. Instagram favors consistent daily posting, while Facebook quality matters more than frequency. Stories should be posted daily for maximum engagement.

**What's the best time to post for salon businesses?**
Generally, Tuesday-Thursday from 11 AM-1 PM and 7-9 PM work best. However, analyze your specific audience insights to find when your followers are most active. Weekend mornings also perform well for beauty content.

**How much should I spend on Facebook and Instagram ads?**
Start with $5-10 per day ($150-300 monthly) for local awareness campaigns. Increase budget based on results. A good rule is 10-15% of monthly revenue on digital marketing, with 60% allocated to social media advertising.

**Should I use the same content on both platforms?**
While you can repurpose content, tailor it to each platform. Instagram favors high-quality visuals and Stories, while Facebook allows longer captions and works well for event promotion and community building.

**How do I handle negative reviews or comments on social media?**
Respond professionally and promptly. Acknowledge concerns, offer to resolve issues privately, and demonstrate your commitment to client satisfaction. Never delete negative comments unless they violate platform guidelines.

**What type of content gets the most bookings?**
Transformation before/after posts generate the highest booking inquiries, followed by behind-the-scenes content that builds trust. Educational posts create long-term engagement, while promotional posts drive immediate action.

**How long does it take to see results from social media marketing?**
Expect initial engagement improvements within 2-4 weeks. Meaningful booking increases typically occur after 6-8 weeks of consistent posting. Full campaign results are usually visible within 90 days.

**Do I need to work with influencers to be successful?**
Influencer partnerships can accelerate growth but aren't required. Focus first on creating quality content and building authentic engagement. Micro-influencers (1K-10K followers) often provide better ROI than larger accounts for local businesses.
