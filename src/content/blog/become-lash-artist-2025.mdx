## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long does it take to become proficient at lash extensions?**
Most artists achieve basic proficiency within 2-3 months of consistent practice. Advanced techniques like mega volume typically take 6-12 months to master. Speed and consistency improve significantly after applying lashes on 50+ clients.

**Do I need to be licensed to do lash extensions?**
Requirements vary by state. Most states require either a cosmetology license (1,000-1,600 hours) or esthetics license (300-750 hours). Five states currently have no licensing requirements, but this may change. Always check current state board regulations.

**How much can I realistically earn as a new lash artist?**
New artists typically earn $15,000-30,000 in their first year while building clientele. By year two, established artists often reach $60,000-100,000 annually. Top artists in major markets can exceed $150,000 with multiple revenue streams.

**What's the difference between classic and volume lashes?**
Classic lashes involve applying one extension to each natural lash (1:1 ratio). Volume lashes use multiple lightweight extensions per natural lash (2D-10D+) for a fuller appearance. Volume requires more advanced training but commands higher prices.

**How often do clients need fills?**
Most clients need fills every 2-3 weeks to maintain fullness as natural lashes shed. The natural lash growth cycle means 20-25% of extensions shed weekly. Proper aftercare can extend time between appointments.

**Is the lash extension market oversaturated?**
While competition exists in major cities, demand continues growing faster than supply. Success depends on skill level, customer service, and marketing rather than market saturation. Specialized techniques and excellent retention create competitive advantages.

**What insurance do I need as a lash artist?**
Professional liability insurance is essential, costing $200-500 annually. Many states also require general liability insurance. Some training programs include insurance guidance, and professional associations offer group rates.

**Can I work from home as a lash artist?**
Home-based lash services are legal in most areas but require proper licensing, zoning compliance, and insurance. Check local regulations as some cities restrict home-based beauty services. Mobile services are often easier to establish legally.
