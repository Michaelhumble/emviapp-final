# The AI Assistant Showdown (For Beauty Pros): ChatGPT vs Gemini vs Claude vs Perplexity

Beauty pros are busy. You don’t need hype; you need **results**—faster hiring, better bios, clearer pricing, and posts that actually get bookings. We tested today’s top AI assistants and distilled what each does best **for real salon and artist workflows**. Then we turned that into **copy-paste prompts** you can use right now.

<Callout type="success">
<strong>TL;DR</strong>  
**ChatGPT** = best all-round writer/ideas → job posts, bios, captions.  
**Claude** = calm long-doc thinker → SOPs, policies, contracts.  
**Gemini** = Google-adjacent speed → image help, search-y tasks, Android/mobile.  
**Perplexity** = fastest citations → “what changed lately?”, market checks, facts.  
Use our playbooks below. When facts matter, open sources and verify.

## The Contenders (What each is actually good at)

| Assistant | Best Use for Beauty Pros | Strengths | Watch-outs | Try it first for… |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ChatGPT** | Writing, idea generation, tone matching | Versatile, creative, supports structured output | Will “assume” facts if you push it | Job posts, bios, captions, menus |
| **Claude** | Long, careful documents | Thoughtful, less likely to ramble | Can be conservative/verbose | SOPs, policies, contracts, training docs |
| **Gemini** | Quick tasks with Google flavor | Snappy, good at bullets, mobile friendly | Occasional formatting quirks | Summaries, checklists, image help |
| **Perplexity** | Fast research with citations | Links out, current info, succinct | Less creative prose | Market checks, “what changed?”, benchmarks |

<Callout type="info">
**How we test:** we time to first useful draft, count edits to publish, and measure engagement on EmviApp posts (clicks, applies, profile views). Your mileage may vary—use the prompts and keep what works.

## Mini case studies (composites based on real outcomes)

**1) Houston nails studio—hiring in 72 hours**  
Owner rewrote their job post with the prompt above, added a real pay range, and pinned culture & growth.  
**Result:** ↑ 2.1× applies in a week, vetted one standout candidate by day 3, hire on day 5.

**2) Independent artist—profile clarity = more trials**  
A senior tech trimmed jargon and led with specialties + years + availability.  
**Result:** ↑ 38% profile views → trials booked from two nearby salons within 10 days.

**3) Multi-chair salon—policies that de-stress**  
Claude drafted clear late/cancel/redo policies; staff trained with a 1-page SOP.

## FAQ

**Is AI writing obvious to readers?**  
Not when you feed it **your real details** and edit for tone. Think of AI like a fast assistant—not a replacement for your taste.

**Will it make things up?**  
Creative models sometimes over-confidently guess. For facts, **use Perplexity** or ask models to provide sources.

**What about privacy?**  
Avoid pasting sensitive client data. Summarize patterns instead of sharing names or identifiers.

**Which model should I start with?**  
If you’re unsure: ChatGPT for drafts + Perplexity for checks. Add Claude when you document SOPs or policies.

**How does this tie to EmviApp?**  
Every prompt here outputs copy you can paste straight into **EmviApp Jobs** or **Artists for Hire**—and the CTAs above link you there.

## Final word

AI won’t run your salon—**you** will. But it will give you time back, sharpen your message, and help the right people find you. Start with one prompt, ship it, then iterate.
