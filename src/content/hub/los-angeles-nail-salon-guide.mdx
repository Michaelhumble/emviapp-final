## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much should I tip at LA nail salons?

Standard tipping is 18-22% of the service cost. For exceptional service or intricate nail art, 25% is appropriate. Cash tips are preferred, and many salons pool tips among staff.

### How long do different nail services last in LA's climate?

LA's dry climate actually helps nail polish last longer. Expect gel manicures to last 2-3 weeks, acrylics 3-4 weeks with proper care, and regular polish 7-10 days depending on lifestyle.

### Are acrylic nails safe if applied properly?

Yes, when applied by licensed technicians using proper products and techniques. The key is finding salons that don't over-file natural nails and use quality acrylic systems from reputable brands.

### What should I do if I get an infection from a nail salon?

Seek medical attention immediately, document the symptoms with photos, report to the California Board of Barbering and Cosmetology, and contact the salon to report the issue. Most reputable salons carry insurance for such situations.

### How can I tell if a salon uses quality products?

Look for recognizable professional brands like OPI, Essie, CND, or Gelish for polishes. For acrylics, brands like Young Nails or Tammy Taylor indicate quality. Ask to see the product bottles - professional products have detailed ingredient lists.

### Should I bring my own tools to a nail salon?

While not necessary at quality salons, bringing your own tools can provide peace of mind. Focus on personal items like files and cuticle pushers. Most reputable salons will accommodate your preference.

### How far in advance should I book during busy seasons?

For regular services, book 1-2 weeks ahead. During prom season (April-June), wedding season (May-October), or holidays, book 3-4 weeks in advance. Celebrity or high-end salons may require 6+ weeks notice.

### What's the difference between gel and dip powder manicures?

Gel requires UV light curing and offers more color variety but can be harder to remove. Dip powder air-dries, lasts longer (3-4 weeks), but has limited color options. Both are healthier than traditional acrylics when applied correctly.
