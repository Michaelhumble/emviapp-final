## FAQ Section

**When should I book my wedding hair and makeup artist?**
Book 3-4 months in advance for most locations, or 5-6 months for peak wedding season (May-October) or popular artists. Holiday weekends require even earlier booking.

**How long should I allow for bridal hair and makeup on wedding day?**
Plan 2.5-3 hours for complete bridal hair and makeup. Add 45-60 minutes per additional person (bridesmaids, mothers). Always build in a 30-minute buffer for timeline flexibility.

**Should I wash my hair the night before or morning of my wedding?**
Wash your hair the night before your wedding. Day-old hair holds styles better and has more texture for updos and curls. Freshly washed hair can be too slippery and clean to hold complex styles.

**What if I don't like my trial makeup or hair?**
Communicate concerns immediately after your trial. Most artists offer one complimentary adjustment session. Bring reference photos and be specific about what you'd like changed. Major style changes may require additional trial fee.

**How do I handle makeup touch-ups throughout the wedding day?**
Your artist should provide a touch-up kit with lipstick, powder, and blotting papers. Designate a bridesmaid to handle minor touch-ups, or book your artist for reception refresh services.

**Should I get lash extensions or false lashes for my wedding?**
Both options work well. Lash extensions applied 1-2 weeks before your wedding create a natural enhanced look. False lashes applied day-of offer more dramatic options and easier removal. Discuss with your makeup artist.

**What if my wedding hair and makeup artist gets sick?**
Professional artists should have backup coverage arrangements. Ask about their emergency policy during booking. Consider booking through established salons that have multiple qualified artists available.

**How do I coordinate beauty timing with my photographer?**
Share your beauty timeline with your photographer at least 2 weeks before your wedding. Plan for "getting ready" photos during beauty application and coordinate any first look or reveal timing needs.

## Create Your Perfect Wedding Day Look

Your wedding beauty should reflect your personal style while ensuring you feel confident and radiant throughout your celebration. With proper planning, the right team, and clear communication, you'll achieve a flawless look that photographs beautifully and lasts from ceremony to last dance.
