## FAQ Section

**What's the best time to post for salons on Instagram and Facebook?**
For most salons, Tuesday-Thursday between 11 AM-2 PM and 7-9 PM perform best. However, analyze your specific audience insights after 30 days of consistent posting to find your optimal times.

**How many hashtags should I use on Instagram posts?**
Use 20-30 hashtags for maximum reach, mixing popular beauty hashtags (#balayage #haircolor) with local tags (#YourCityHair #YourNeighborhoodSalon) and branded hashtags (#YourSalonName).

**Should I boost posts or run actual ads?**
Start with boosting your best-performing organic posts to your target demographic within 25 miles. Once you understand what resonates, create dedicated ad campaigns for new client acquisition.

**How do I handle negative comments or reviews publicly?**
Respond quickly and professionally, acknowledge the concern, and offer to resolve privately. Example: "We're sorry this wasn't your experience, [Name]. Please DM us so we can make this right."

**What's the difference between business and personal Instagram accounts?**
Business accounts provide analytics, contact buttons, and advertising capabilities. Always use a business account for your salon to access these essential features.

**How often should I post on each platform?**
Instagram: 4-7 posts per week plus 3-5 stories daily. Facebook: 3-5 posts per week. Consistency matters more than frequency - choose a schedule you can maintain long-term.

**Should I repost the same content on both platforms?**
While you can cross-post, tailor content to each platform's audience. Instagram favors visual storytelling and younger demographics, while Facebook works better for detailed information and community building.

**How do I get clients to give permission for before/after photos?**
Make it part of your service agreement, explain how it helps your business grow, and offer incentives like discounts on future services or exclusive access to new treatments.
