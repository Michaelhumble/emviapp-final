This file was created to trigger a full sync of the EmviApp project to GitHub repository: Michaelhumble/emviapp-final

Timestamp: 2025-01-27T10:30:00Z

This ensures all current files, changes, and any existing TypeScript errors are pushed to the connected GitHub repository exactly as they exist in the Lovable project.
