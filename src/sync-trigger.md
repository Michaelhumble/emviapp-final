# Sync Trigger - Force Complete Push to GitHub

This file was updated to trigger a COMPLETE sync of the EmviApp project to GitHub repository: Michaelhumble/emviapp-final

## Sync Details
- **Repository**: https://github.com/Michaelhumble/emviapp-final
- **Timestamp**: 2025-01-27T10:45:00Z
- **Action**: FORCE COMPLETE SYNC
- **Status**: PUSHING ALL FILES NOW

## What Should Be Synced
- All React/TypeScript components in src/
- All configuration files (package.json, etc.)
- All styling and assets
- All hooks and utilities
- All dashboard components
- All community features
- All authentication logic
- All database integrations
- ALL files exactly as they exist in Lovable

## Verification
After this sync completes, the GitHub repository should contain:
- Latest src/ directory with all components
- Updated package.json and dependencies
- All TypeScript files with current code
- All existing errors/issues as-is (no fixes applied)

**This is a FORCED SYNC - ALL CURRENT PROJECT FILES SHOULD NOW BE IN GITHUB**

## File Count Check
The GitHub repo should contain hundreds of files in the src/ directory matching the current Lovable project structure.
