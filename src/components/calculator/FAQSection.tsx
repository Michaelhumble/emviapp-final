      answer: 'Yes. EmviApp uses paid listings to keep quality high and reduce spam. You can choose monthly visibility (1, 3, 6, or 12 months) with discounted longer terms. All listings expire after 30 days unless you renew or enable auto-renew.',

      question: '‚è∞ What happens when my listing expires?',
      answer: "We'll show the last active day and give you one-click renew options. If auto-renew is off, your listing simply stops showing until you renew.",

      question: '‚¨ÜÔ∏è Can I upgrade visibility later?',
