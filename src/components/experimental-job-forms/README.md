# Experimental Job Forms - TESTING ONLY

This folder contains new, simplified, and experimental job posting forms for safe testing and development.

## Purpose
- Testing new form designs and schemas
- Sandbox for Zod/React-Hook-Form experiments
- Clean, minimal job posting flows
- Safe area for development without affecting production

## Route Information
- `/post-job-experimental` - Uses forms from this folder for testing

## Development Guidelines
1. These forms are sandboxed and can be safely edited, rebuilt, or deleted
2. Do not import or depend on legacy job template files
3. Use only their own types, schemas, and new components
4. Never reference legacy template logic

## Current Status
This folder contains experimental forms that are not yet ready for production use.
