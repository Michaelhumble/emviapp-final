## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue 1: "Couldn't fetch" sitemap error
**Solutions:**
- Wait 1 hour, resubmit
- Test sitemap URL in browser (should return XML)
- Check Supabase edge function logs
- Verify edge function is deployed

### Issue 2: Homepage not indexing after 3 days
**Solutions:**
- URL Inspection ‚Üí Request indexing again
- Check for `noindex` meta tag (should not exist)
- Verify robots.txt allows crawling
- Check canonical URL is correct

### Issue 3: Logo not appearing in brand search
**Solutions:**
- Verify Organization schema:
  ```
  https://search.google.com/test/rich-results?url=https://www.emvi.app
  ```
- Ensure logo URL: `https://www.emvi.app/android-chrome-512x512.png`
- Re-request indexing for homepage
- Wait 7-10 days (logos are cached by Google)

### Issue 4: Sitemaps show "Pending" for days
**Solutions:**
