# 🌞 Sunshine Chatbot Behavior Test Plan

## ✅ FIXED ISSUES:

### 1. **Memory & Introduction Logic**
- ✅ Sunshine only introduces herself ONCE per session
- ✅ Names are extracted and remembered correctly  
- ✅ No repeated self-introductions
- ✅ Session persistence works across page refreshes

### 2. **Name Handling**
- ✅ Enhanced name extraction from multiple patterns
- ✅ Immediate session saving when name is provided
- ✅ Consistent name usage in Vietnamese and English
- ✅ No mixing up names between users

### 3. **Backend Session Management**
- ✅ Fixed database session logic
- ✅ Proper name updates without overwriting
- ✅ Context-aware responses based on user history

## 🧪 TEST SCENARIOS:

### Scenario 1: First Time User (Expected: Introduction)
1. **User:** "hello"
2. **Expected:** "Hi there! I'm Sunshine ☀️ What's your name? I can chat in Vietnamese or English—whatever you prefer!"
3. **User:** "My name is Michael"
4. **Expected:** "Hi Michael, so glad you're here! How can I help you today?"
5. **User:** "em co the giup anh nhung gi?"
6. **Expected:** "Chào Michael! Em có thể giúp anh [specific help based on message]" (NO introduction)

### Scenario 2: Returning User (Expected: No Introduction)
1. **User:** Opens chat (with existing session)
2. **Expected:** Sunshine remembers name, NO self-introduction
3. **User:** "tim tho"
4. **Expected:** "Chào [Name]! [Direct help with job search]" (NO introduction)

### Scenario 3: Cross-Language Consistency
1. **User:** "anh tên là David" (Vietnamese)
2. **Expected:** "Chào anh David! Em có thể giúp gì cho anh hôm nay? 😊"
3. **User:** "what can you help me with?" (English)
4. **Expected:** "Hi David! [English response]" (Uses same name)

### Scenario 4: Name From Different Patterns
- ✅ "My name is Sarah" → Extracts "Sarah"
- ✅ "I'm Michael" → Extracts "Michael"  
- ✅ "Anh tên là David" → Extracts "David"
- ✅ "Em tên là Lisa" → Extracts "Lisa"
- ❌ "Anh muốn tìm việc" → Does NOT extract "việc" or "tìm"

## 🔧 KEY FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. **Frontend (ChatSystem.tsx):**
   - Only show greeting if no messages AND no userName
   - Immediate session saving when name is extracted
   - Better name handling in message processing
   - Simplified greeting logic

2. **Backend (sunshine-chat/index.ts):**
   - Enhanced system prompt with strict rules
   - Better session state management
   - Context-aware responses
   - No repeated introductions logic

3. **Name Extraction (languageDetection.ts):**
   - Already had strict patterns to prevent false extractions
   - Protected against action-based text

## 🚨 CRITICAL VERIFICATION POINTS:

✅ **Never introduce twice:** If user has a name, NEVER say "I'm Sunshine" again
✅ **Name consistency:** Once extracted, always use the same name
✅ **Language switching:** Name persists across Vietnamese/English  
✅ **Session restoration:** Name and conversation state survive refreshes
✅ **No false extractions:** Don't extract names from "tìm việc", "help me", etc.

## 🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR NOW:

1. **First greeting:** Only when completely new user
2. **Name introduction:** Warm acknowledgment, save immediately  
3. **All subsequent:** Direct help using their name
4. **Cross-session:** Remembers everything, no re-introductions
5. **Mixed languages:** Seamless name usage in both languages
