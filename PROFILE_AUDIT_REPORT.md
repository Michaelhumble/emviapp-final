# Profile System Audit Report

## Current File Structure Analysis

### 1. Routing Files
- `src/pages/profile/UserProfilePage.tsx` - Main profile page route
- `src/components/profile/UserProfile.tsx` - Profile wrapper component
- `src/components/profile/RoleSpecificProfile.tsx` - Role routing logic

### 2. Profile Components Found
- `src/components/profile/ArtistProfile.tsx` - Artist-specific profile
- `src/components/profile/SalonProfile.tsx` - Salon-specific profile  
- `src/components/profile/FreelancerProfile.tsx` - Freelancer-specific profile
- `src/components/profile/customer/PremiumCustomerProfile.tsx` - Customer profile

### 3. Auth Context Analysis
- User role comes from `useAuth()` hook
- Role detection: `userRole` from auth context
- Role normalization handled in auth utilities

## WHY IT FAILED BEFORE

1. **Import Path Issues**: The existing `src/components/artist/ArtistProfile.tsx` was a placeholder that just returned "Artist Profile Component"
2. **Missing Component Exports**: New profile components weren't properly connected to the routing system
3. **Fallback Logic**: RoleSpecificProfile was falling back to customer profile for unmatched roles
4. **Component Isolation**: Each profile component needs to be completely self-contained

## PROPOSED FIX

Add unique visual identifiers and ensure proper component loading for each role.
