# üîß PAID NAIL JOB FLOW - CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

## ‚úÖ FIXED ISSUES

### 1. **Crash Prevention - Payment Redirect**
- **Problem**: App crashed due to popup/new tab redirect losing session context
- **Solution**: Changed from `window.open()` to direct `window.location.href` redirect
- **Result**: No more "Breaking Browser Locker Behavior" crashes

### 2. **Photo Upload & Display**
- **Problem**: Photos weren't uploading properly, database had "photos-uploaded" placeholder
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced `NailJobPostForm.tsx` with robust photo upload to Supabase Storage
  - Fixed `create-job-checkout` to store photo URLs in metadata
  - Updated `stripe-webhook` to extract and set photo URLs from metadata
  - Enhanced `BilingualJobCard.tsx` to detect photos from multiple sources (metadata, direct fields)
- **Result**: Photos now upload correctly and display in job cards/modals

### 3. **Contact Info Display**
- **Problem**: Contact info not showing on paid job cards or modals
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced `BilingualJobCard.tsx` to check multiple sources for contact info (metadata, direct fields, legacy)
  - Fixed webhook to properly extract and set contact_info from metadata
  - Added comprehensive debug logging for contact info flow
- **Result**: Contact info now displays properly for paid jobs

### 4. **Database Record Issues**
- **Problem**: Database records had placeholders instead of real photo URLs
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed webhook to extract photo URLs from metadata and set them in job fields
  - Enhanced metadata handling to preserve photo arrays and contact info
- **Result**: Database now stores actual photo URLs and contact information

## üö® IMPORTANT NOTES

2. **Metadata Priority**: Photos and contact info are now checked in metadata first
3. **Multi-Source Support**: Enhanced to handle various data storage formats
4. **No New Features**: Only fixed the critical bugs, no scope creep
5. **Backward Compatible**: Still works with existing job formats

## ‚úÖ VERIFICATION COMPLETE
