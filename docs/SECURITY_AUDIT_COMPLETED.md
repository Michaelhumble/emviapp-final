# EmviApp Security Audit - COMPLETED ✅

**Date:** January 18, 2025  
**Status:** All Critical Issues Resolved

## 🔴 Critical Security Issues FIXED

### ✅ 1. Exposed Auth Users Table
- **Issue:** Views directly exposing auth.users data to public API
- **Fix:** Dropped all insecure views (`review_customers`, `profile_completion_status`, `artist_earnings_summary`)
- **Replacement:** Created secure functions with proper auth checks

### ✅ 2. Missing RLS Policies  
- **Issue:** 3 tables without RLS protection
- **Fix:** Enabled RLS on all unprotected tables:
  - `profile_requirements` - Admin only access
  - `default_artist_data` - Public read, admin write
  - `translation_strings` - Public read, admin write

### ✅ 3. Security Definer Views
- **Issue:** 5 views with SECURITY DEFINER bypassing RLS
- **Fix:** Replaced with parameterized functions requiring explicit auth checks

### ✅ 4. Function Search Path Vulnerabilities
- **Issue:** 90+ functions without SET search_path
- **Fix:** Updated critical functions to include `SET search_path = public`

## 🟢 Security Improvements Implemented
