### 5. Notification System (Backend)
- [ ] Create a test job with specific role+city
- [ ] Call `notify-job-alerts` edge function with job details
- [ ] Check `outbound_email_queue` table - emails should be queued
- [ ] Verify HTML template renders correctly with unsubscribe link

### 6. Sitemaps

- [ ] Visit `/alerts-sitemap.xml` - should return 200 OK, valid XML
- [ ] Both should include correct URLs and be well-formed

### 7. SEO & Schema

## üìä Test Data & Queries

### Create Test Alert
```sql
INSERT INTO job_alerts (email, role, city)
VALUES ('test@example.com', 'Nail Technician', 'New York, NY');
```

### Check Alerts
```sql
SELECT * FROM job_alerts WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

### Check Email Queue
```sql
SELECT * FROM outbound_email_queue WHERE to_email = 'test@example.com';
```

### Delete Test Data
```sql
DELETE FROM job_alerts WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
DELETE FROM outbound_email_queue WHERE to_email = 'test@example.com';
```

## üîê Security Checks

- ‚úÖ Email validation (must contain @)
- ‚úÖ RLS enabled on both tables
- ‚úÖ Service role required for email queue
- ‚úÖ No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Unsubscribe requires exact email match
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data exposed in URLs

## üö® Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Email Sending**: Emails are queued but not sent yet. Requires email provider integration (future phase).
2. **Duplicate Alerts**: Users can create multiple alerts for same role+city. This is intentional for flexibility.
3. **No Authentication**: Alert signup is anonymous. Users identify by email only.
4. **Static Salary Data**: Calculator uses hardcoded baselines for ~25 cities. Others show no comparison.

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] All 3 pages render without errors
- [ ] Calculator performs instant calculations
- [ ] Job alerts stores data correctly
- [ ] Unsubscribe removes records
- [ ] Sitemaps return valid XML
- [ ] Lighthouse SEO ‚â• 95
- [ ] No RLS violations
- [ ] Micro-CTA visible on city/role pages

## üéâ Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate
- [ ] Submit `/tools-sitemap.xml` to Google Search Console
- [ ] Submit `/alerts-sitemap.xml` to Google Search Console
- [ ] Test calculator with 5 different role+city combinations
- [ ] Create 3 test job alerts and verify database entries

### Within 48 Hours
- [ ] Monitor `job_alerts` table growth
- [ ] Check for any console errors in production
- [ ] Verify sitemap indexing status in GSC
- [ ] Test unsubscribe flow with real email

### Within 1 Week
- [ ] Analyze calculator usage (page views, time on page)
- [ ] Check job alerts signup conversion rate
- [ ] Review email queue table for any issues
- [ ] Plan email provider integration (Phase 5)

## üìù Notes

- **No Emails Sent**: System only queues emails. Integration with SendGrid/Mailgun/etc. needed for actual sending.
- **Static Baselines**: Salary comparison data is static. Consider adding admin panel to update values.
- **Anonymous Alerts**: No user accounts required. Unsubscribe uses email+role+city matching.
- **Micro-CTA Non-Invasive**: Only shows on city/role pages where it's contextually relevant.
