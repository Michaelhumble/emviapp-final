# GSC Indexing Request Execution Plan
# Generated: 2025-01-21
# Purpose: Track indexing request status and quota usage

## QUOTA LIMITS
- Daily Limit: 200 URL submissions per project
- Rate Limit: 2 requests per second recommended
- Service Account: Same limits as OAuth

## EXECUTION SCHEDULE
Phase 1 (Immediate): Core Pages (13 URLs)
- Homepage, main categories, key utility pages
- Estimated quota usage: 13/200 (6.5%)

Phase 2 (Same Day): High-Value Content (35 URLs)  
- Top job pages, popular city/role combinations
- Estimated quota usage: 48/200 (24%)

Phase 3 (Next Day): Extended Content (39 URLs)
- Blog posts, additional location pages
- Estimated quota usage: 39/200 (19.5%)

## MONITORING
- Check Google Search Console for processing status
- Track success/failure rates in generated reports
- Monitor quota usage to avoid exhaustion

## SAFETY MEASURES
- Dry run mode available (--dry-run flag)
- Batch processing with rate limiting
- Conservative daily limits (180 vs 200 max)
- Error logging and recovery

## USAGE EXAMPLES
```bash
# Test run (no actual requests)
node scripts/gsc-indexing-request.mjs --dry-run

# Submit first 20 URLs with 3-second delays
node scripts/gsc-indexing-request.mjs --batch-size=5 --delay=3000

# Full submission (respects daily limits)
node scripts/gsc-indexing-request.mjs
```

## EXPECTED RESULTS
- Faster indexing of priority pages
- Improved organic search visibility
- Better crawl efficiency allocation
- Enhanced new content discovery
