## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Authentication Options
```bash
# Option 1: API Key (simpler setup)
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Option 2: Service Account (recommended for production)
export GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY='{"type":"service_account",...}'
```

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Test run (no actual requests sent)
./scripts/run-gsc-indexing.sh --dry-run

# Live execution with safety limits
./scripts/run-gsc-indexing.sh

# Custom batch processing
node scripts/gsc-indexing-request.mjs --batch-size=3 --delay=3000
```

### Quota Management
- **Daily Limit**: 200 URL submissions per Google project
- **Safety Limit**: 180 submissions (90% of max)
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-second delays between requests
- **Batch Size**: 5 URLs per batch (configurable)

## üìä Expected Benefits
