### The Formula:
1. **First Impression** (Hero) — 5 seconds to capture attention
2. **Trust Signals** — Immediate credibility builders
3. **Value Clarity** — Crystal-clear "what's in it for me"
4. **Social Proof** — Real people making real money
5. **Frictionless CTA** — Dead-simple to start
6. **Objection Handling** — FAQ that eliminates doubt
7. **FOMO Elements** — Scarcity + urgency (ethical)

## 📊 CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### ✅ What's Good:
- Clean Hero with glass morphism
- Earnings calculator (interactive)
- How It Works (clear 3-step)
- Testimonials exist
- FAQ section
- Proper SEO/meta tags

### ❌ What's Missing (Critical):
1. **Live stats bar** — No real-time social proof
2. **Sticky CTA** — CTA disappears when scrolling
3. **Comparison table** — No "why EmviApp vs others"
4. **Success story cards** — Testimonials lack detail
5. **Trust badges** — No Stripe/security logos
6. **Tier showcase** — Don't show the 4-tier system on landing
7. **Video testimonial** — Text only, no face/voice
8. **Exit-intent popup** — Missing last-chance conversion
9. **Live activity feed** — "John just earned $240" notifications
10. **Premium animations** — Static, needs micro-interactions
